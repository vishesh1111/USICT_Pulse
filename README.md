## Overview

USICT PULSE is the all-in-one student intelligence platform tailored for USICT, GGSIPU. Whether you're a junior looking for your first internship, a senior scaling your mentor profile, or just someone who wants honest reviews of professors before semester registration — PULSE has it covered. Built with a cinematic glassmorphism UI in both dark and light modes, an AI assistant powered by Google Gemini, and a real database backing every interaction.

## Highlights

- **AI Assistant powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash** — answers from a live RAG context combining your DB, opportunities, and resources.
- **Stunning UI** — frosted-glass navbar, animated active pill, scroll-reveal motion, particle ambience, light + dark mode parity.
- **Two onboarding flows** — separate experiences for juniors (1st/2nd year) and seniors (3rd/4th year), each tailored to their goals.
- **Real-time leaderboard** — seniors ranked by helpfulness, with top-3 podium glow effects.
- **Mobile-first** — slide-in drawer, bottom-sheet inputs, responsive grid down to 360px.
- **Production-ready** — deployed on Vercel with Supabase Postgres + Prisma, type-safe end to end.

## Features

### Core Modules

| Module | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | Personalized home with welcome card, stats, featured opportunities, closing deadlines, application tracker, and recommended mentors. |
| **Opportunities** | Browse curated internships, scholarships, club inductions, and local events. Filter by branch, type, and status. |
| **Ask** | Anonymous Q&A platform. Post questions, vote helpful answers, get responses from seniors and alumni. |
| **Connect** | Find mentors from your branch and year. Direct connect with one click. |
| **Alumni** | Discover where USICT graduates work, their journey, and reach out via LinkedIn. |
| **Teachers** | Honest faculty reviews — difficulty, marking trends, subjects taught, student ratings. |
| **Resources** | Subject-wise notes, videos, GitHub repos, cheatsheets — recommended by toppers. Upload your own files too. |
| **Leaderboard** | Top seniors ranked by mentor score (helpful answers + activity). Podium for top 3. |
| **Notifications** | Personalized alerts for deadlines, mentor replies, and new opportunities. |
| **Profile** | Editable bio, social links (GitHub, LinkedIn), achievements, and credibility score. |

### AI Chatbot (PULSE Assistant)

A floating chat widget available on every page. The assistant is RAG-powered — it pulls live context from:
- Recent Q&A from the database
- All current opportunities (with eligibility, deadlines, apply links)
- Curated learning resources

It also knows your profile (branch, year, interests) and personalizes responses accordingly. Streams responses in markdown for clean formatting.

### UI / UX 

- **Glassmorphism design** — frosted blur, soft indigo-tinted shadows, cool-white light mode and deep navy dark mode.
- **Animated navbar** — floating pill bar with shadow-on-scroll, sliding active indicator (Framer Motion `layoutId`), grouped "More" dropdown with icons.
- **Scroll-reveal animations** — `FadeIn`, `StaggerContainer`, `AnimatedCounter`, `FloatingParticles`, `GlowPulse` primitives.
- **Hover states everywhere** — colored glows per accent (purple for Q&A, orange for alumni, amber for deadlines), scale + lift on cards.
- **Mobile drawer** — spring-physics slide-in with staggered link entrance.
- **Splash screen** — animated logo with pulse rings + floating particles on first visit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **18.17+**
- npm / pnpm / yarn
- A Supabase project (free tier works)
- A Google AI Studio API key ([get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
- (Optional) An EmailJS account for welcome emails

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishesh1111/USICT_Pulse.git
cd USICT_Pulse
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is needed because of React 19 RC peer dependency mismatches with some libs. The project's `.npmrc` handles this automatically.


### 3. Set up the database

Push the Prisma schema to your Supabase database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

(Optional) Seed sample data:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the app will auto-redirect to `/onboarding` on first visit.

## Project Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Generate Prisma client + production build |
| `npm run start` | Run the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint with Next.js rules |
| `npm run db:push` | Sync Prisma schema to your Supabase DB |
| `npm run db:seed` | Insert sample data (questions, users, etc.) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio (visual DB editor) |

## Deployment

This project is optimized for **Vercel**. To deploy:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add the environment variables (same as `.env.local`)
4. Deploy

The build command (`prisma generate && next build`) is already set in `package.json`. The `.npmrc` handles peer-dep conflicts. No extra config needed.

> **Note:** The chat API route uses `maxDuration = 60`, which requires Vercel **Pro** plan. On Hobby plan, change it to `10` in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`.

## Feautres:-

- [ ] Real-time chat between mentor and mentee/Senior (Supabase Realtime)
- [ ] OAuth login (Google + GitHub)
- [ ] Push notifications for deadlines (Web Push API)
- [ ] Calendar export for opportunities (.ics)
- [ ] Resource voting + comments
- [ ] Anonymous teacher reviews moderation queue
- [ ] Branch-specific channels in Connect
- [ ] AI resume reviewer (upload PDF, get feedback)
